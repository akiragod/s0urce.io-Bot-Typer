# s0urce.io-Bot-Typer
A Bot Typer for s0urce.io, that types words that have been seen before already. This is legit, and works perfectly fine, as this bot saves words that are correctly typed, and automatically re-types that word again for you when you come across it. And for the retards (no offense) who think this is illegal, *IT'S NOT, SO HOLD YOUR THOUGHTS RIGHT THERE.*

Hope You Enjoy!!!! ;D

Oh, I almost forgot to tell you how to use this! Just click on the .user.js file, copy & paste all the text in this file into a new userscript on TamperMonkey, and save by pressing Ctrl+S! Or you could click on the file on press Raw, then TamperMonkey should ask if you want to download the script!
